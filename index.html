<section id="history">
    <h2>HISTORY & FACTS</h2>
    <p>The islands are believed to be around two million years old, formed during the Pleistocene epoch. They are actually ancient coral reefs that were part of the seabed of an ancient sea. Lowering sea levels exposed them to the surface.</p>
    <p>Declared the first national park in the Philippines by former President Manuel L. Quezon on January 18, 1940, under Presidential Proclamation No. 667.</p>
    <p><b>FACTS:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>124 islands at low tide, 123 at high tide.</li>
        <li>Many have mushroom-like shapes due to erosion.</li>
        <li>Only a few developed for tourism: Governor's, Quezon, Children's, Pilgrimage.</li>
        <li>Steeped in folklore: giant's tears, warring chieftains.</li>
        <li>Also called Kapulo-puloan or Taytay-Bakes.</li>
        <li>Recognized as National Geological Monument.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>PERSONAL REVIEWS</h2>
    <div class="card"><br><b>STEPHANIE:</b></br> I haven't been to Hundred Islands yet, but based on everything I've seen and heard from other travelers, it really seems like a place worth visiting. The photos and reviews make it look peaceful and exciting at the same time clear blue water, clean islands, and a lot of activities like snorkeling, kayaking, and exploring viewpoints. What I really like is that many people say the area is well-maintained and budget-friendly, which makes it even more inviting for someone planning a first visit. I’m honestly looking forward to experiencing it myself soon especially the island-hopping part and seeing the views in person instead of just online. It feels like the kind of destination where you can relax, enjoy nature, and create good memories.</div>
    <div class="card"><br><b>JANILA:</b><br> As someone from Binmaley, I've always felt lucky that the Hundred Islands is just a short ride away and after visiting three times, I can say that the experience never loses its charm. Every trip feels different, and the beauty of the islands still amazes me. Though the place gets crowded during peak season, the atmosphere still feels welcoming, and the locals are friendly. The whole experience feels close to home literally and emotionally. For me, Hundred Islands isn’t just a tourist spot; it’s a reminder of the natural beauty we Pangasinenses can be proud of. I’d say Hundred Islands is worth visiting not just once, but again and again.</div>
    <div class="card"><br><b>YVINT:</b></br> As a local from Alaminos, I grew up going to Hundred Islands because our family reunions and our church anniversaries were usually held there. I’ve only visited around three islands and tried the banana boat before, but I still enjoyed it. The place has nice views and clear water. It can get crowded sometimes, but it’s still a good spot to relax and spend time with family. Even with my simple experiences there, I still think it’s a place worth visiting.</div>
    <div class="card"><br><b>MERABEL:</b></br> I haven't been to Hundred Islands yet, but I really want to go. The place looks beautiful with its many small islands surrounded by clear blue water. It seems peaceful, perfect for swimming, snorkeling, and exploring caves. I’m most excited to try the zipline because it looks fun and gives a great view of the islands from above. I imagine feeling the wind while seeing the wide ocean beneath me. Hundred Islands feels like a simple but amazing escape where I can relax, enjoy nature, and try new adventures. I hope to visit soon and experience everything for myself.</div>
    <div class="card"><br><b>KHLEYA:</b></br> I haven't been to Hundred Islands yet but I can already tell how beautiful it is from the pictures I’ve seen online. The clear blue water and the many small islands look so peaceful and breathtaking. We actually had plans to go there before, and I was really excited because I had been looking forward to the trip for a long time. Sadly, it didn’t happen but I still hope that someday we’ll be able to visit. I believe it would be an unforgettable experience and I can’t wait for the time when I can finally see it in person.
